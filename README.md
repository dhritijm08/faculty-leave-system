Hello there, it's Dhriti here thank you for stopping by my project here's what it is about:


📝 **Faculty Leave System**

This is a web-based application to make it easy and automate the faculty leave request and approval process.



📌 **Project Summary**

The Faculty Leave System allows faculty members to submit leave requests and enables department heads, deans, and principals to review, approve, or reject them. It provides role-based access to ensure secure and smooth handling of the entire workflow. Users will have to register their details manually in this code, but you can upload a CSV file in the database with the respective information. The functionality remains the same.
